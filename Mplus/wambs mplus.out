INPUT INSTRUCTIONS

  TITLE: Bayesian analysis;

  DATA: FILE IS phd-delays_nonames.csv;

  VARIABLE: NAMES ARE diff child sex Age Age2; ! All the variables in the dataset

  USEVARIABLES ARE diff Age Age2; ! The variables we use in this analysis

  ANALYSIS:
  ESTIMATOR IS bayes; ! Specify that we want to use a Bayesian analysis
  Bseed = 23082018; !specify a seed value for reproducing the results
  CHAINS = 3; ! set the number of chains we want to use
  FBITERATIONS = 2000 ! this is how we set the number of iterators

  MODEL:
  [diff] (intercept);       ! specify that we want an intercept
  ! this model would also work without this line, but this way it is possible to easily set
  diff ON Age (Beta_Age);   ! Regression coefficient 1.
  diff ON Age2(Beta_Age2);  ! Regression coefficient 2
  ! You need to name these regression coefficients to later set priors
  diff (e);                 ! Error variance

  MODEL PRIORS:
    Beta_Age ~ N(.8, 5); ! These are the different priors
    Beta_Age2 ~ N(0, 10);
    intercept ~  N(-35, 20);
    e ~ IG(0.5, 0.5);


  OUTPUT:
    cinterval(hpd); !to request CIs based on higher posterior density intervals
    tech8; !to request additional information about priors and convergence

  PLOT:
      TYPE IS PLOT2; !to request for plots
